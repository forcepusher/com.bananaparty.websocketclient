# com.bananaparty.websocketclient  
  
Unity package. Fully cross-platform WebSocket client library.

Make sure you have standalone [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed first. Reboot after installation.  
In Unity, open "Window" -> "Package Manager".  
Click the "+" sign on top left corner -> "Add package from git URL..."  
Paste this: `https://github.com/forcepusher/com.bananaparty.websocketclient.git#1.1.0`
